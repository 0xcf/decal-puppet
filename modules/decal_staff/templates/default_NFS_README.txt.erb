Hi <%= @user -%>!

Please create a file in this directory named 'food.txt' and put the name of
your favorite food in it! Make sure to put the name of this food in your lab
check off too. Since this is mounted using NFS, whatever you write to the
`food.txt` file will actually be stored on the remote server so we can read it!
